    // A "player" is not one object, and the one you can see is not always the one that dies:
    //
    //   * A DUPLICATED player has a separate SlimeController and PlayerCollision per clone,
    //     each standing somewhere different, all sharing one player id.
    //   * A player INSIDE AN ABILITY has had their slime switched off
    //     (SlimeController.gameObject.SetActive(false)); the ability object stands in for
    //     them and carries its own PlayerCollision.
    //
    // Two consequences, and both are easy to walk into:
    //
    //   * FindObjectsOfType SKIPS INACTIVE OBJECTS, so searching for SlimeControllers cannot
    //     see anyone who is inside an ability. A projectile aimed at someone mid-Roll passes
    //     straight through them.
    //   * Player.Position is a SINGLE POINT for the whole player. It cannot describe where
    //     several clones are, so testing it and then killing one remembered body kills the
    //     wrong one -- and, because the test stays true next tick, kills again. Player.Kill
    //     only ends a player when their last clone goes, so removing them all at once reads
    //     as the whole player dying and hands out the round.
    //
    // So target BODIES, not players: ask the scene for every live PlayerCollision, test each
    // at ITS OWN position, and kill the ones actually inside the effect. One contact removes
    // one body.
